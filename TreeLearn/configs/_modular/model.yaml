model:
  kernel_size: 3 # kernel size of convolution layers
  channels: 32 # channel size of first convolution layer
  num_blocks: 7 # number of blocks to be used in the Unet or Lnet
  use_feats: False # whether to use precomputed features as network input or not (default is False)
  use_coords: False # whether to use the coordinates as network input or not. Coords are redundant since relativ position defined by voxel grid (default is False)
  dim_coord: 3 # dimension of coordinates
  dim_feat: 1 # dimension of precomputed features
  max_num_points_per_voxel: 3 # maximum number of points within a voxel to use for feature averaging (the value of this does not matter that much)
  fixed_modules: [] # modules whose parameters are not updated during training
  spatial_shape: ~ # spatial shape of the tiles/crops. Can be set to ~ during training but should be set to a high enough number to cover the voxel extensions of the largest tile during inference
  voxel_size: 0.1 # determines the voxel size in m
